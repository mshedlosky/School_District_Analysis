# School District Analysis
## Overview of School District Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to investigate the relationships of various characteristics such as budget, grades, school type, and population within multiple schools in the PyCity school disrict. While there was an initical analysis performed, it was revealed that the information within Thomas High School for 9th graders was inaccurate. Thus, a second analysis was conducted accounting for this new information.

## Results
- Desite the updates made to the Thomas High School data, the impact to the District Summary was not material. Figures A1 and B1 support this statement.

- The Thomas High School summary was greatly affected with the updated data accounted for. Their overall passing percentage dropped to the last of the 15 schools after the recalculation. Their overall passing percentange tanked from 91% to 67%, respectively. Figures A2 and B2 illustrate this decrease in ranking from top 20.

- The math and reading scores for Thomas High School were adjusted to NaN ('Not a Number') for the 9th graders, while the other individuals in grades 10-12 were unaffected. Image B3 reflects what NaN looks like within the reading scores dataframe for the 9th graders at Thomas High School. This is also what appears in the math scores for the 9th graders of Thomas High School.

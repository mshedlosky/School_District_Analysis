# School District Analysis
## Overview of School District Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to investigate the relationships of various characteristics such as budget, grades, school type, and population within multiple schools in the PyCity school disrict. While there was an initical analysis performed, it was revealed that the information within Thomas High School for 9th graders was inaccurate. Thus, a second analysis was conducted accounting for this new information.

## Results
- Desite the updates made to the Thomas High School data, the impact to the District Summary was not material. Figures A1 and B1 support this statement.

- The Thomas High School summary was greatly affected with the updated data accounted for. Their overall passing percentage dropped to the last of the 15 schools, compared to prior where they were situated in the top 50%. Figures A2 and B2 illustrate this decrease in ranking.
